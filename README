habiter is a simple tool for maintaining good habits

It can be used with the 'don't break the chain' technique, like
Joe's Goals or Sciral Consistency, but adopts more positive
techniques and uses a readable and editable YAML text file as
storage.

clean_room is not a habit yet. create and complete it? (y/n) y
~$ habiter did jog
